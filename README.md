# Timer
This is a basic timer webapp built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It takes inputs using two <input> elements for number of minutes and seconds respectively. 
It has a start button to start the timer and a stop button which is only visible when the timer is running. 
The start button is hidden when the timer is working. 
After the countdown, a 3 second beep plays and the timer resets to the initial input.
I don't think it needs any other features, other than options for the beep. I might consider adding that but most likely not. There are other projects I'd like to attempt as well.
